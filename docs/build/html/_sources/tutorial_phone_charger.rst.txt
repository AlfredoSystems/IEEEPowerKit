Wireless Phone Charger Tutorial
------------------------------------

We're going to start by writing a simple program to test using PestoLink to control any motors or servos connected to your NoU3 via the ESP32's Bluetooth.

.. note:: For this section, you'll at least need Alfredo NoU3 ready to drive some motors. Follow our `Build Tutorial <https://youtu.be/rcdbkeYA1rs>`_ to set that up before continuing here.
   
.. seealso:: If you just need an example program to test motor and servo movement without an explanation, use the **motor party** example sketch included with Alfredo-NoU3.
   
When you open up the Arduino IDE, you'll see an empty program (a "sketch") that looks like this:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="image-row-container">
       <img src="../images/readings.png" alt="Image 1" height="200px">
       <img src="../images/thin.png" alt="Image 2" height="200px">
   </div>

.. code-block:: cpp

    void setup() {

    }

    void loop() {

    }
